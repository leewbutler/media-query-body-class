media-query-body-class
======================

- Applies a &lt;body class="[SomeClass]"> depending on what CSS media query is in effect.

- Useful for flagging when a particular layout (or grid system) should be in effect on your responsive site.

- Written in native inline js (with no library dependencies) so the class is present on page load.

- See the code for more documentation.
